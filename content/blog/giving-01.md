We have recently arranged and paid for a water delivery for community residents
since there is no running water right now. The water truck delivered water to
residents and filled their tanks. We also prepared care packages including flour,
sugar, oil, toilet paper, bleach and food to distribute to the elderly. There is
a major food shortage and this is crucial. We also visited each resident to help
them apply for government assistance during this time, since many do not have
internet access or the skills needed to apply on their own.

Any donation goes towards these efforts. We are now raising money to stock the
chicken coop in order to provide fresh meat for the community.
